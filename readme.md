  ## Description
  This project was made as an API to connect to a front end social media site. Similar to twitter, users can post thoughts that other users can see and react to. 

  ## Problems and Lessons
  Although I was able to get most of the API functioning I still have an issue deleting items. Even when I delete them they still appear when you query the database for all users, posts, etc. The date created function also isn't formatted correctly.

  ## Installation
  Clone the repository from github and run npm i

  ## Usage 
  once you have cloned the repository and installed the necessary packages you can start the server by running npm start. Either use insomnia to use routes or connect it to a front end of your choosing!
